				<h1>Epsilon Alpha Rho</h1>
				<br /><br />
				2013 - Public Intervention - Purchase College (SUNY) Campus Great Lawn<br />
				Collaboration for TP13 with Sarah Venti, Kaitlyn Power, Connor Wilson, Elsa Fraysse, and Mette Kj√∏lbro
				<br /><br />
				<p>Epsilon Alpha Rho, or EAP, was a public intervention and collaboration meant to protest the possible creation of Greek Fraternities or Sororities on Purchase College campus. The project was funded by work done earlier in the semester in which each individual had to find a way to make $100 in a way that they normally wouldn't. This money was then pooled together to fund the larger projects at the end of the semester. EAP in particular used the money to create requruiment materials and events including posters, a bake sale, and eventually culminating in a large sign-up/rush during finals week.<br /><br />For the creation of the Frat, instead of following rigid rules and rituals for membership, anyone was alloed to join and in fact if you simply walked by you were declared already a member and invited to join in the activites during the final event. During the event, the point was made to celebrate the openness of the frat, inviting anyone to come, make a t-shirt, eat pizza, play music, or generally enjoy the company of friends and utilize the services provided from our Frat house, a rented bouncy castle.<br /><br />The event was an overall success, encouraging open community whilst simultaneously pointing out the ills and rediculousness of the fraternity system in general.
