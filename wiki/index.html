<p>Coffee is a brewed beverage prepared from the roasted seeds of several
species of an evergreen shrub of the genus Coffea. The two most common
sources of coffee beans are the highly regarded Coffea arabica, and the
"robusta" form of the hardier Coffea canephora. The latter is resistant
to the coffee leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix), but has a more bitter
taste. Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in
equatorial Latin America, Southeast Asia, Maldives, and Africa. Once
ripe, coffee "berries" are picked, processed, and dried to yield the
seeds inside. The seeds are then roasted to varying degrees, depending
on the desired flavor, before being ground and brewed to create coffee.
</p><p>Coffee is slightly acidic (pH 5.0–5.1[1]) and can have a stimulating
effect on humans because of its caffeine content. It is one of the most
popular drinks in the world.[2] It can be prepared and presented in a
variety of ways. Many studies have examined the health effects of
coffee, and whether the overall effect of coffee consumption is positive
or negative has been widely disputed.[3] The majority of recent research
suggests that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial
in healthy adults. However, coffee can worsen the symptoms of some
conditions such as anxiety, largely due to the caffeine and diterpenes
it contains. 
</p><p>Coffee cultivation first took place in southern Arabia;[4]
the earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking appears in the middle
of the 15th century in the Sufi shrines of Yemen.[4] In East Africa and
Yemen, coffee was used in native religious ceremonies that were in
competition with the Christian Church. As a result, the Ethiopian Church
banned its secular consumption until the reign of Emperor Menelik II of
Ethiopia.[5] The beverage was also banned in Ottoman Turkey during the
17th century for political reasons[6] and was associated with rebellious
political activities in Europe. 
</p><p>An important export commodity, coffee
was the top agricultural export for twelve countries in 2004,[7] and it
was the world's seventh-largest legal agricultural export by value in
2005.[8] Green (unroasted) coffee is one of the most traded agricultural
commodities in the world.[9] Some controversy is associated with coffee
cultivation and its impact on the environment. Consequently, organic
coffee is an expanding market.</p>

<div id="info_2" class="grid_12 info">
<p>The first reference to "coffee" in the English language is in the
form chaoua, dated to 1598. In English and other European languages,
"coffee" descends from the Italian word: caffè. In turn, caffè derives
from the Ottoman Turkish word for coffee: kahve, which is itself derived
from the Arabic: قهوة‎, qahwah. Arab lexicographers maintain that qahwah
originally referred to a type of wine, and gave its etymology, in turn,
to the verb قها qahā, signifying "to have no appetite",[10][11] since
this beverage was thought to dull one's hunger. </p><p>Several
alternative etymologies exist that hold that the Arab form may disguise
a loanword from an Ethiopian or African source, suggesting Kaffa, the
highland in southwestern Ethiopia as one, since the plant is indigenous
to that area.[12] </p>
</div>
<div id="info_3" class="grid_12 info">
<h1>Legendary accounts</h1>
<p>According to legend, ancestors of today's Oromo people were believed to have been the first to recognize the energizing effect of the coffee plant,[4] though no direct evidence has been found indicating where in Africa coffee grew or who among the native populations might have used it as a stimulant or even known about it, earlier than the 17th century.[4] The story of Kaldi, the 9th-century Ethiopian goatherder who supposedly discovered coffee when his goats behaved strangely after eating from a coffee plant, did not appear in writing until 1671 and is probably apocryphal.[4] The original domesticated coffee plant is said to have been from Harar.[13]
</p><p>Other accounts attribute the discovery of coffee to Sheik Omar. According to the ancient chronicle (preserved in the Abd-Al-Kadir manuscript), Omar, who was known for his ability to cure the sick through prayer, was once exiled from Mocha, Yemen to a desert cave near Ousab. Starving, Omar chewed berries from nearby shrubbery, but found them to be bitter. He tried roasting the seeds to improve the flavor, but they became hard. He then tried boiling them to soften the seed, which resulted in a fragrant brown liquid. Upon drinking the liquid Omar was revitalized and sustained for days. As stories of this "miracle drug" reached Mocha, Omar was asked to return and was made a saint.[14] From Ethiopia, the beverage was introduced into the Arab world through Egypt and Yemen.[15]
</p><h1>Historical transmission</h1>
</p><p>The earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century, in the Sufi monasteries around Mocha in Yemen.[4] It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed, in a similar way to how it is now prepared. By the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia, Turkey, and northern Africa. Coffee seeds were first exported from Ethiopia to Yemen. Yemeni traders brought coffee back to their homeland and began to cultivate the seed. The first coffee smuggled out of the Middle East was by Sufi Baba Budan from Yemen to India in 1670. Before then, all exported coffee was boiled or otherwise sterilised. Portraits of Baba Budan depict him as having smuggled seven coffee seeds by strapping them to his chest. The first plants grown from these smuggled seeds were planted in Mysore.[16] Coffee then spread to Italy, and to the rest of Europe, to Indonesia, and to the Americas.[17]
</p><br />

<p>In 1583, Leonhard Rauwolf, a German physician, gave this description of coffee after returning from a ten-year trip to the Near East:
</p><p>A beverage as black as ink, useful against numerous illnesses, particularly those of the stomach. Its consumers take it in the morning, quite frankly, in a porcelain cup that is passed around and from which each one drinks a cupful. It is composed of water and the fruit from a bush called bunnu.
</p><p>—Léonard Rauwolf, Reise in die Morgenländer (in German)
</p><p>From the Middle East, coffee spread to Italy. The thriving trade between Venice and North Africa, Egypt, and the Middle East brought many goods, including coffee, to the Venetian port. From Venice, it was introduced to the rest of Europe. Coffee became more widely accepted after it was deemed a Christian beverage by Pope Clement VIII in 1600, despite appeals to ban the "Muslim drink." The first European coffee house opened in Italy in 1645.[17]
</p><br />

<p>The Dutch East India Company was the first to import coffee on a large scale.[18] The Dutch later grew the crop in Java and Ceylon.[19] The first exports of Indonesian coffee from Java to the Netherlands occurred in 1711.[20]
</p><p>Through the efforts of the British East India Company, coffee became popular in England as well. Oxford's Queen's Lane Coffee House, established in 1654, is still in existence today. Coffee was introduced in France in 1657, and in Austria and Poland after the 1683 Battle of Vienna, when coffee was captured from supplies of the defeated Turks.[21]
</p><p>When coffee reached North America during the Colonial period, it was initially not as successful as it had been in Europe as alcoholic beverages remained more popular. During the Revolutionary War, the demand for coffee increased so much[22] that dealers had to hoard their scarce supplies and raise prices dramatically; this was also due to the reduced availability of tea from British merchants,[23] and a general resolution among many Americans to avoid drinking it due to the Boston Tea Party.[24]
</p><p>After the War of 1812, during which Britain temporarily cut off access to tea imports, the Americans' taste for coffee grew. Coffee consumption declined in England, giving way to tea during the 18th century. The latter beverage was simpler to make, and had become cheaper with the British conquest of India and the tea industry there.[25] During the Age of Sail, seamen aboard ships of the British Royal Navy made substitute coffee by dissolving burnt bread in hot water.[26]
</p><p>The Frenchman Gabriel de Clieu brought a coffee plant to the French territory of Martinique in the Caribbean, from which much of the world's cultivated arabica coffee is descended. Coffee thrived in the climate and was conveyed across the Americas.[27] The territory of Santo Domingo (now Haiti) saw coffee cultivated from 1734, and by 1788 it supplied half the world's coffee.[28] The conditions that the slaves worked in on coffee plantations were a factor in the soon to follow Haitian Revolution. The coffee industry never fully recovered there.[29]
</p><p>Meanwhile, coffee had been introduced to Brazil in 1727, although its cultivation did not gather momentum until independence in 1822.[30] After this time, massive tracts of rainforest were cleared first from the vicinity of Rio and later São Paulo for coffee plantations.[31] Cultivation was taken up by many countries in Central America in the latter half of the 19th century, and almost all involved the large-scale displacement and exploitation of the indigenous people. Harsh conditions led to many uprisings, coups and bloody suppression of peasants.[32] The notable exception was Costa Rica, where lack of ready labor prevented the formation of large farms. Smaller farms and more egalitarian conditions ameliorated unrest over the 19th and 20th centuries.[33]
</p><p>Coffee has become a vital cash crop for many developing countries. Over one hundred million people in developing countries have become dependent on coffee as their primary source of income. It has become the primary export and backbone for African countries like Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, and Ethiopia,[34] as well as many Central American countries.

<div id="info_4" class="grid_12 info">
<p>Several species of shrub of the genus Coffea produce the berries from which coffee is extracted. The two main species commercially cultivated are Coffea canephora (predominantly a form known as 'robusta') and C. arabica.[35] C. arabica, the most highly regarded species, is native to the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia and the Boma Plateau in southeastern Sudan and possibly Mount Marsabit in northern Kenya.[36] C. canephora is native to western and central Subsaharan Africa, from Guinea to the Uganda and southern Sudan.[37] Less popular species are C. liberica, C. stenophylla, C. mauritiana, and C. racemosa.
</p><p>All coffee plants are classified in the large family Rubiaceae. They are evergreen shrubs or small trees that may grow 5 m (15 ft) tall when unpruned. The leaves are dark green and glossy, usually 10–15 cm (4–6 in) long and 6 cm (2.4 in) wide. The flowers are axillary, and clusters of fragrant white flowers bloom simultaneously and are followed by oval berries of about 1.5 cm (0.6 in).[38] Green when immature, they ripen to yellow, then crimson, before turning black on drying. Each berry usually contains two seeds, but 5–10% of the berries[39] have only one; these are called peaberries.[40] Arabica berries ripen in six to eight months, while robusta take nine to eleven months.[41]
</p><p>Coffea arabica is predominantly self-pollinating, and as a result the seedlings are generally uniform and vary little from their parents. In contrast, Coffea canephora, and C. liberica are self-incompatible and require outcrossing. This means that useful forms and hybrids must be propagated vegetatively.[42] Cuttings, grafting, and budding are the usual methods of vegetative propagation.[43] On the other hand, there is great scope for experimentation in search of potential new strains.[42]
</p>
</div>
<div id="info_5" class="grid_12 info">
<p>The traditional method of planting coffee is to place 20 seeds in each hole at the beginning of the rainy season. This method loses about 50% of the seeds' potential, as about half fail to sprout. A more effective method of growing coffee, used in Brazil, is to raise seedlings in nurseries that are then planted outside at six to twelve months. Coffee is often intercropped with food crops, such as corn, beans, or rice during the first few years of cultivation as farmers become familiar with its requirements.[38]
</p><p>Of the two main species grown, arabica coffee (from C. arabica) is generally more highly regarded than robusta coffee (from C. canephora); robusta tends to be bitter and have less flavor but better body than arabica. For these reasons, about three-quarters of coffee cultivated worldwide is C. arabica.[35] Robusta strains also contain about 40–50% more caffeine than arabica.[44] For this reason, it is used as an inexpensive substitute for arabica in many commercial coffee blends. Good quality robusta seeds are used in traditional Italian espresso blends to provide a full-bodied taste and a better foam head (known as crema).[45]
</p><p>However, Coffea canephora is less susceptible to disease than C. arabica and can be cultivated in lower altitudes and warmer climates where C. arabica will not thrive.[46] The robusta strain was first collected in 1890 from the Lomani River, a tributary of the Congo River, and was conveyed from Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) to Brussels to Java around 1900. From Java, further breeding resulted in the establishment of robusta plantations in many countries.[47] In particular, the spread of the devastating coffee leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix), to which C. arabica is vulnerable, hastened the uptake of the resistant robusta. Coffee leaf rust is found in virtually all countries that produce coffee.[48]
</p><p>Over 900 species of insect have been recorded as pests of coffee crops worldwide. Of these, over a third are beetles, and over a quarter are bugs. Some 20 species of nematodes, 9 species of mites, several snails and slugs also attack the crop. Birds and rodents sometimes eat coffee berries but their impact is minor compared to invertebrates.[49] In general, arabica is the more sensitive species to invertebrate predation overall. Each part of the coffee plant is assailed by different animals. Nematodes attack the roots, and borer beetles burrow into stems and woody material,[50] the foliage is attacked by over 100 species of larvae (caterpillars) of butterflies and moths.[51]
</p><p>Mass spraying of insecticides has often proven disastrous, as the predators of the pests are more sensitive than the pests themselves.[52] Instead, integrated pest management has developed, using techniques such as targeted treatment of pest outbreaks, and managing crop environment away from conditions favouring pests. Branches infested with scale are often cut and left on the ground, which promotes scale parasites to not only attack the scale on the fallen branches but in the plant as well.[53]
</p><p>The 2-mm-long coffee berry borer beetle is the most damaging insect pest to the world’s coffee industry, destroying up to 50 percent or more of the coffee berries on plantations in most coffee-producing countries. The adult female beetle nibbles a single tiny hole in a coffee berry and lays 35 to 50 eggs. Inside, the offspring grow, mate, and then emerge from the commercially ruined berry to disperse, repeating the cycle. Pesticides are mostly ineffective because the beetle juveniles are protected inside the berry nurseries, but they are vulnerable to predation by birds when they emerge. When groves of trees are nearby, the American Yellow Warbler, Rufous-capped Warbler and other insectivorous birds have been shown to reduce by 50 percent the number of coffee berry borer beetles in Costa Rica coffee plantations.[54]

<div id="info_6" class="grid_12 info">
<p>In 2011 Brazil was the world leader in production of green coffee, followed by Vietnam, Indonesia and Colombia.[57] Arabica coffee seeds are cultivated in Latin America, eastern Africa, Arabia, or Asia. Robusta coffee seeds are grown in western and central Africa, throughout southeast Asia, and to some extent in Brazil.[35]
</p><p>Seeds from different countries or regions can usually be distinguished by differences in flavor, aroma, body, and acidity.[58] These taste characteristics are dependent not only on the coffee's growing region, but also on genetic subspecies (varietals) and processing.[59] Varietals are generally known by the region in which they are grown, such as Colombian, Java and Kona.

<div id="info_7" class="grid_12 info">
<p>Originally, coffee farming was done in the shade of trees that provided a habitat for many animals and insects.[60] Remnant forest trees were used for this purpose, but many species have been planted as well. These include leguminous trees of the genera Acacia, Albizia, Cassia, Erythrina, Gliricidia, Inga, and Leucaena, as well as the nitrogen-fixing non-legume sheoaks of the genus Casuarina, and the silky oak Grevillea robusta.[61]
</p><p>This method commonly referred to as the traditional shaded method, or "shade-grown". Starting in the 1970s, many farmers switched their production method to sun cultivation, in which coffee is grown in rows under full sun with little or no forest canopy. This causes berries to ripen more rapidly and bushes to produce higher yields, but requires the clearing of trees and increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, which damage the environment and cause health problems.[62]
</p><p>Unshaded coffee plants grown with fertilizer yield the most coffee, although unfertilized shaded crops generally yield more than unfertilized unshaded crops: the response to fertilizer is much greater in full sun.[63] Although traditional coffee production causes berries to ripen more slowly and produce lower yields, the quality of the coffee is allegedly superior.[64] In addition, the traditional shaded method provides living space for many wildlife species. Proponents of shade cultivation say environmental problems such as deforestation, pesticide pollution, habitat destruction, and soil and water degradation are the side effects of the practices employed in sun cultivation.[60]
</p><p>The American Birding Association, Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center,[65] National Arbor Day Foundation,[66] and the Rainforest Alliance have led a campaign for 'shade-grown' and organic coffees, which can be sustainably harvested.[67] Shaded coffee cultivation systems show greater biodiversity than full-sun systems, and those more distant from continuous forest compare rather poorly to undisturbed native forest in terms of habitat value for some bird species.[68][69]
</p><p>Another issue concerning coffee is its use of water. According to New Scientist, using industrial farming practices, it takes about 140 liters (37 US gal) of water to grow the coffee seeds needed to produce one cup of coffee, and the coffee is often grown in countries where there is a water shortage, such as Ethiopia.[70]
</p><p>By using sustainable agriculture methods, the amount of water usage can be dramatically reduced, while retaining comparable yields. For comparison, the United States Geological Survey reports that one egg requires an input of 454 liters (120 US gal) of water; one serving of milk requires an input of 246 liters (65 US gal) of water; one serving of rice requires an input of 132 liters (35 US gal) of water; and one glass of wine requires an input of 120 liters (32 US gal) of water.[71]
</p><p>Coffee grounds may be used for composting or as a mulch. They are especially appreciated by worms and acid-loving plants such as blueberries.[72] Some commercial coffee shops run initiatives to make better use of these grounds, including Starbucks' "Grounds for your Garden" project,[73] and community sponsored initiatives such as "Ground to Ground".[74]
</p><p>Starbucks sustainability chief Jim Hanna has warned that Climate change may significantly impact coffee yields within a few decades.[75]
</p>
</div>
<div id="info_8" class="grid_12 info">
<h1>Processing</h1>
<p>Coffee berries and their seeds undergo several processes before they become the familiar roasted coffee. Berries have been traditionally selectively picked by hand; a labor intensive method, it involves the selection of only the berries at the peak of ripeness. More commonly, crops are strip picked, where all berries are harvested simultaneously regardless of ripeness by person or machine. After picking, green coffee is processed by one of two methods—the dry process method, simpler and less labor intensive as the berries can be strip picked, and the wet process method, which incorporates fermentation into the process and yields a mild coffee.[76]
Then they are sorted by ripeness and color and most often the flesh of the berry is removed, usually by machine, and the seeds are fermented to remove the slimy layer of mucilage still present on the seed. When the fermentation is finished, the seeds are washed with large quantities of fresh water to remove the fermentation residue, which generates massive amounts of coffee wastewater. Finally, the seeds are dried.[77]
The best (but least used) method of drying coffee is using drying tables. In this method, the pulped and fermented coffee is spread thinly on raised beds, which allows the air to pass on all sides of the coffee, and then the coffee is mixed by hand. In this method the drying that takes place is more uniform, and fermentation is less likely. Most African coffee is dried in this manner and certain coffee farms around the world are starting to use this traditional method.[77]
Next, the coffee is sorted, and labeled as green coffee. Another way to let the coffee seeds dry is to let them sit on a concrete patio and rake over them in the sunlight. Some companies use cylinders to pump in heated air to dry the coffee seeds, though this is generally in places where the humidity is very high.[77]
Some coffee undergoes a peculiar process, such as kopi luwak. It is made from the seeds of coffee berries which have been eaten by the Asian Palm Civet and other related civets, passing through its digestive tract. This process resulted in coffee seeds with much less bitterness,[citation needed] widely noted as the most expensive coffee in the world with prices reaching $160 per pound.[78]
<h1>Roasting</h1>
</p><p>The next step in the process is the roasting of the green coffee. Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state, and with rare exceptions all coffee is roasted before it is consumed. It can be sold roasted by the supplier, or it can be home roasted.[79] The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage by changing the coffee seed both physically and chemically. The seed decreases in weight as moisture is lost and increases in volume, causing it to become less dense. The density of the seed also influences the strength of the coffee and requirements for packaging.
</p><p>The actual roasting begins when the temperature inside the seed reaches approximately 200 °C (392 °F), though different varieties of seeds differ in moisture and density and therefore roast at different rates.[80] During roasting, caramelization occurs as intense heat breaks down starches, changing them to simple sugars that begin to brown, which alters the color of the seed.[81]
</p><p>Sucrose is rapidly lost during the roasting process and may disappear entirely in darker roasts. During roasting, aromatic oils and acids weaken, changing the flavor; at 205 °C (401 °F), other oils start to develop.[80] One of these oils, caffeol, is created at about 200 °C (392 °F), which is largely responsible for coffee's aroma and flavor.[19]
</p><p>Grading the roasted seeds[edit]
</p><p>Depending on the color of the roasted seeds as perceived by the human eye, they will be labeled as light, medium light, medium, medium dark, dark, or very dark. A more accurate method of discerning the degree of roast involves measuring the reflected light from roasted seeds illuminated with a light source in the near infrared spectrum. This elaborate light meter uses a process known as spectroscopy to return a number that consistently indicates the roasted coffee's relative degree of roast or flavor development.
</p><h1>Roast characteristics</h1>
<p>The degree of roast has an effect upon coffee flavor and body. Darker roasts are generally bolder because they have less fiber content and a more sugary flavor. Lighter roasts have a more complex and therefore perceived stronger flavor from aromatic oils and acids otherwise destroyed by longer roasting times.[82] Roasting does not alter the amount of caffeine in the bean, but does give less caffeine when the beans are measured by volume because the beans expand during roasting.[83]
</p><p>A small amount of chaff is produced during roasting from the skin left on the seed after processing.[84] Chaff is usually removed from the seeds by air movement, though a small amount is added to dark roast coffees to soak up oils on the seeds.[80]
</p><h1>Decaffeination</h1>
<p>Decaffeination may also be part of the processing that coffee seeds undergo. Seeds are decaffeinated when they are still green. Many methods can remove caffeine from coffee, but all involve either soaking the green seeds in hot water (often called the "Swiss water process")[85] or steaming them, then using a solvent to dissolve caffeine-containing oils.[19] Decaffeination is often done by processing companies, and the extracted caffeine is usually sold to the pharmaceutical industry.[19]
</p><h1>Storage</h1>
<p>Once roasted, coffee seeds must be stored properly to preserve the fresh taste of the seed. Ideally, the container must be airtight and kept in a cool, dry and dark place. In order of importance: air, moisture, heat, and light are the environmental factors[86] responsible for deteriorating flavor in coffee seeds. Folded-over bags, a common way consumers often purchase coffee, are generally not ideal for long-term storage because they allow air to enter. A better package contains a one-way valve, which prevents air from entering.[86] In 1931, a method of vacuum packed cans of coffee was introduced, in which the roasted coffee was packed, 99% of the air was removed and the coffee in the can could be stored indefinitely until the can was opened. Today this method is in mass use for coffee in a large part of the world.[87]
</p><h1>Brewing</h1>
<p>The closable pressure container has a dual outlet to dispense espresso into two cups simultaneously.
</p><p>
Espresso brewing, showing desirable dark reddish-brown crema
</p><p>Coffee seeds must be ground and brewed to create a beverage. The criteria for choosing a method include flavor and economy. Almost all methods of preparing coffee require the seeds to be ground and mixed with hot water long enough to extract the flavor, but without overextraction that draws out bitter compounds. The spent grounds are removed and the liquid is consumed. There are many brewing variations such as the fineness of grind, the ways in which the water extracts the flavor, additional flavorings (sugar, milk, spices), and spent ground separation techniques. The ideal holding temperature is 79 to 85 °C (174 to 185 °F) and the ideal serving temperature is 68 to 79 °C (154 to 174 °F)[citation needed].
</p><p>The roasted coffee seeds may be ground at a roastery, in a grocery store, or in the home. Most coffee is roasted and ground at a roastery and sold in packaged form, though roasted coffee seeds can be ground at home immediately before consumption. It is also possible, though uncommon, to roast raw seeds at home.
</p><p>Roasting has a heavy influence on brewing. Lighter roasted coffee tends to be used for filter coffee as the combination of method and roast style results in higher acidity, complexity and a clearer nuances. Darker roasted coffee is used for espresso because the machine naturally extracts more dissolved solids into the cup resulting in lighter coffee being too acidic.
</p><p>Coffee seeds may be ground in several ways. A burr grinder uses revolving elements to shear the seed; a blade grinder cuts the seeds with blades moving at high speed; and a mortar and pestle crushes the seeds. For most brewing methods, a burr grinder is deemed superior because the grind is more even and the grind size can be adjusted.

</p><p>The type of grind is often named after the brewing method for which it is generally used. Turkish grind is the finest grind, while coffee percolator or French press are the coarsest grinds. The most common grinds are between the extremes; a medium grind is used in most common home coffee-brewing machines.[88]
</p><p>Coffee may be brewed by several methods: boiled, steeped, or pressurized.
</p><p>Brewing coffee by boiling was the earliest method, and Turkish coffee is an example of this method.[89] It is prepared by grinding or pounding the seeds to a fine powder, then adding it to water and bringing it to the boil for no more than an instant in a pot called a cezve or, in Greek, a bríki. This produces a strong coffee with a layer of foam on the surface and sediment (which is not meant for drinking) settling on the bottom of the cup.[89]
</p><p>Coffee percolators and automatic coffeemakers brew coffee using gravity. In an automatic coffeemaker hot water drips onto coffee grounds held in a coffee filter made of paper, plastic, or perforated metal, allowing the water to seep through the ground coffee while extracting its oils and essences. The liquid drips through the coffee and the filter into a carafe or pot, and the spent grounds are retained in the filter.[90]
</p><p>In a percolator, boiling water is forced into a chamber above a filter by steam pressure created by boiling. The water then seeps through the grounds, and the process is repeated until terminated by removing from the heat, by an internal timer,[90] or by a thermostat that turns off the heater when the entire pot reaches a certain temperature.
</p><p>Coffee may be brewed by steeping in a device such as a French press (also known as a cafetière, coffee press or coffee plunger).[91] Ground coffee and hot water are combined in a cylindrical vessel and left to brew for a few minutes. A circular filter which fits tightly in the cylinder fixed to a plunger is then pushed down from the top to force the grounds to the bottom. Because the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the water, all the coffee oils remain in the beverage, making it stronger and leaving more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic coffee machine.[91] The coffee is poured from the container; the filter retains the grounds at the bottom. 95% of the caffeine is released from the coffee seeds within the first minute of brewing.
</p><p>The espresso method forces hot pressurized and vaporized water through ground coffee. As a result of brewing under high pressure (ideally between 9–10 atm), the espresso beverage is more concentrated (as much as 10 to 15 times the quantity of coffee to water as gravity-brewing methods can produce) and has a more complex physical and chemical constitution.[92] A well-prepared espresso has a reddish-brown foam called crema that floats on the surface.[88] Other pressurized water methods include the moka pot and vacuum coffee maker.
</p><p>Cold brew coffee is made by steeping coarsely ground seeds in cold water for several hours, then filtering them.[93] This results in a brew lower in acidity than most hot-brewing methods.
</p><h1>Serving</h1>
<p>Presentation can be an integral part of coffeehouse service, as illustrated by the rosetta design layered into this latte.
</p><p>Once brewed, coffee may be served in a variety of ways. Drip-brewed, percolated, or French-pressed/cafetière coffee may be served as white coffee with a dairy product such as milk or cream, or dairy substitute, or as black coffee with no such addition. It may be sweetened with sugar or artificial sweetener. When served cold, it is called iced coffee.
</p><p>Espresso-based coffee has a wide variety of possible presentations. In its most basic form, an espresso is served simply alone as a shot, or short black, or with hot water added, known as Caffè Americano. Reversely, long black is made by pouring a double espresso into an equal portion of water, which retains the crema compared to Caffè Americano.[94] Milk is added in various forms to an espresso: steamed milk makes a caffè latte,[95] equal parts steamed milk and milk froth make a cappuccino,[94] and a dollop of hot foamed milk on top creates a caffè macchiato.[96] The use of steamed milk to form patterns such as hearts or maple leaves is referred to as latte art.
</p><p>Coffee can also be incorporated with alcohol in beverages—it is combined with whiskey in Irish coffee, and forms the base of alcoholic coffee liqueurs such as Kahlúa, and Tia Maria. Coffee is also sometimes used in the brewing process of darker beers, such as a stout or porter.
</p><h1>Instant coffee</h1>
<p>A number of products are sold for the convenience of consumers who do not want to prepare their own coffee.
</p><p>Instant coffee is dried into soluble powder or freeze-dried into granules that can be quickly dissolved in hot water.[97] Originally invented in 1907,[98][99] it rapidly gained in popularity in many countries in the post-war period, with Nescafé being the most popular product.[100] Many consumers determined that the convenience in preparing a cup of instant coffee more than made up for a perceived inferior taste.[101] Paralleling (and complementing) the rapid rise of instant coffee was the coffee vending machine, invented in 1947 and multiplying rapidly through the 1950s.[102]
</p><p>Canned coffee has been popular in Asian countries for many years, particularly in China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Vending machines typically sell varieties of flavored canned coffee, much like brewed or percolated coffee, available both hot and cold. Japanese convenience stores and groceries also have a wide availability of bottled coffee drinks, which are typically lightly sweetened and pre-blended with milk. Bottled coffee drinks are also consumed in the United States.[103]
</p><p>Liquid coffee concentrates are sometimes used in large institutional situations where coffee needs to be produced for thousands of people at the same time. It is described as having a flavor about as good as low-grade robusta coffee, and costs about 10¢ a cup to produce. The machines can process up to 500 cups an hour, or 1,000 if the water is preheated.[104]
