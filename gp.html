				<h1>Gallery Pong</h1>
				<br /><br />
				2012 - Processing based Interactive Installation
				<br /><br />
				<p>Gallery Pong is a variation on the classic video game pong that plays with the fact of it's presentation as a gallery artwork. The piece is placed in a gallery behind a line that the viewer is not meant to cross. However, in order to play the game the player must cross the line to move the paddle using light sensors. These sensors, when activated by the player getting closer to the piece and thus crossing the line also trigger a loud alarm as a security system might when a piece is being stolen. This allows the piece to comment on the gallery as both a place where art lives as well as the rules of the galley in actively encouraging the viewer to break these rules and then punishing them for it. It also breaks the rules of the gallery as a quiet place of contemplation as it sounds the alarm loudly and shatters any silence around it.
