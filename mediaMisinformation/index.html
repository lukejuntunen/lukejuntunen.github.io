&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370/MAS370)[a] was a scheduled
international passenger flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing that lost
contact with air traffic control on 8 March 2014 at 01:20 MYT,[b]
less than an hour after takeoff. At 07:24, Malaysia Airlines (MAS)
reported the flight missing. The aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER, was
carrying 12 Malaysian crew members and 227 passengers from 14
nations. There has been no confirmation of any flight
debris and no crash site has been found.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A multinational search and rescue effort, later reported as the largest
in history, began in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China
Sea. Within a few days, the search was extended to the Strait of
Malacca and Andaman Sea. On 15 March, based on military
radar data and radio "pings" between the aircraft and an Inmarsat
satellite, investigators concluded that the aircraft had headed west
across the Malay Peninsula, then continued on a northern or southern
track for approximately seven hours. The search in the South
China Sea was abandoned. Three days later, the Australian Maritime
Safety Authority began searching the southern part of the Indian Ocean.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 24 March, the Malaysian government confirmed two independently made
analyses by the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and
Inmarsat; announcing that all search efforts would be concentrated on
the Australian-led area and that the earlier search areas would be
abandoned.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first two weeks of April aircraft and ships deployed
equipment to listen for signals from the underwater locator beacons
attached to the aircraft's "black box" flight recorders. Some signals
were detected but nothing was found; and after the batteries of the
beacons were believed to have been exhausted, robotic submarines were
brought into the search.<br /><br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The February 2011 Christchurch earthquake was a powerful natural event
that severely damaged New Zealand's second-largest city, killing 185
people in one of the nation's deadliest peacetime disasters.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magnitude 6.3 (ML) earthquake[1] struck the Canterbury Region in New
Zealand's South Island at 12:51 pm on Tuesday, 22 February 2011 local
time (23:51 21 February UTC). The earthquake was centred 2
kilometres (1.2 mi) west of the port town of Lyttelton, and 10
kilometres (6 mi) south-east of the centre of Christchurch, New
Zealand's second-most populous city. It followed nearly six months
after the magnitude 7.1 Canterbury earthquake of 4 September 2010, which
caused significant damage to Christchurch and the central Canterbury
region, but no direct fatalities.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earthquake caused widespread damage across Christchurch, especially
in the central city and eastern suburbs, with damage exacerbated by
buildings and infrastructure already being weakened by 4 September 2010
earthquake and its aftershocks. Significant liquefaction affected the
eastern suburbs, producing around 400,000 tonnes of silt. The shallow
earthquake was reported to be felt across the South Island and the lower
and central North Island. While the initial quake only lasted around 10
seconds, the vicinity and depth of its location to Christchurch in
addition to the previous quakes were the reason for so much destruction.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, 185 people were killed in the earthquake,[6][7] making it the
second-deadliest natural disaster recorded in New Zealand (after the
1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake), and fourth-deadliest disaster of any kind
recorded in New Zealand, with nationals from more than 20 countries
among the victims. Over half of the deaths occurred in the
six-storey Canterbury Television (CTV) Building, which collapsed and
caught fire in the quake. The government declared a state of national
emergency, which stayed in force until 30 April 2011.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total cost to insurers of rebuilding was originally estimated at
NZ$15 billion. At that point it was already predicted to be by
far New Zealand's costliest natural disaster, and the third-costliest
earthquake (nominally) worldwide. But by April 2013, the total
estimated cost had ballooned to $40 billion. Some economists have
estimated it will take the New Zealand economy 50 to 100 years to
completely recover. The earthquake was the most damaging in a
year-long earthquake swarm affecting the Christchurch area. It was
followed by a large aftershock on 13 June (which caused considerable
additional damage) and a series of large shocks on 23 December 2011.<br /><br /><br />
