Football season was over, but it was January and apparently the University's basketball team was undefeated, going into a huge game against their biggest rival. It was a weeknight, which was weird in terms of bouncing but the bar was expecting a heavy turn out once the game ended. I'd been deeply depressed all day after learning that J.D. Salinger had just died. I wasn't really in the mood to work, but hey, when you live hand to mouth on a shoestring budget, one hundred fifty bucks sounds good all the time - no matter who dies. When I got the phone call, I was cleaning the mats in the dojo with Haoa. We barely had time to go home, shower, change, and grab a mouthpiece. As a bouncer you always carry a mouthpiece. You carry it in your front pocket and you make sure that nothing else is in that front pocket but the mouthpiece. You also wear a protective cup, because people like to think they can end a fight quickly by kicking you in the scrotum. This is not the case when one uses such foresight.

     By the time we got to the bar, the game was almost finished and given that the home team was losing by a landslide, there were a great deal of fans who'd already forsaken the court side contest and begun to drown their disappointment. The whole joint was filling up fast.

     My own morose demeanor was difficult to contain, and in an uncharacteristic show of angst I took my shift drink within twenty minutes of being there. A bouncer gets only one shift drink, meaning that he can obtain a beverage of his choice, on the house, once, while he is working. I usually wait until my shift is over to take mine, if I take it at all. But goddamn it, J.D. Salinger was dead, and I couldn't fucking deal with it. The man wrote Catcher in the Rye! He had been at D-Day and survived the Battle of the Bulge! He'd given up fame and notoriety to disappear into seclusion and write stories that he refused to show to anyone and kept locked away in a safe (so it was rumored, it is also rumored that he burned them all). He was a legend to me, the last of the old foul dudes, and part of the reason I fell in love with literature at a young age. Now I would be forced to place him in the ranks of my posthumous pantheon - with Bukowski, Hunter Thompson, and Fitzgerald. All of my heroes were dead. Some part of me inside was being siphoned away, slowly.
