 "Hey can I see your ID please?"

     "You're the bouncer?"

     "Yes sir, can I check your ID?"

     "Shit, I could toss you clear across the room if I wanted to!" he laughs to his friend behind him while reaching into his back pocket to produce his wallet/ID etc.

     "Well, it's unfortunate you feel that way, sir, you have yourself a good night." I said, waving him through and handing his ID back to him.

     Right then I knew the evening would end with violence. Haoa came over and asked me about the interaction. I told him to keep an eye on that guy and his friend. The game was over and the place was getting about as full as it usually did during the Fall when football fever was in effect. I continued to visually check in with Phoebe and Jess, the bartenders - this is another one of those things particular to the job of bouncing. Paying attention to the bartenders and who they cut off. Phoebe has seniority back there and it is her that I take my cues from. It is a subtle sort of affair. Last weekend, some jerk tried to reach across the bar and slip his index finger down her exposed cleavage - I didn't see this, and it wasn't a game night so Haoa wasn't there. Phoebe slapped this guy across the face, with a smile on hers, then reached into the register and removed a crisp green bill.

     "Hey I'll give you twenty bucks if you go start a fight with that little guy sitting by the door over there." She said, pointing at me. And naturally, with signature alpha male bravado, the guy takes the twenty and comes over to where I am sitting at my post.

     It was fast and ugly and this was mostly because the guy wound up to punch me from about three feet away. This made it easy to see the blow coming. I elected to jump in and head-butt him while he lumbered at me with his fist cocked back, trying to throw his punch like he was hurling a baseball. And yeah, it hurt. Slamming the top of your forehead into the bridge of a man's nose is not a painless process for anyone involved in the matter. But it is here that my theory on dreams, goals, achievements, etc, directly corresponds to my theory on bar fighting. Something will be sacrificed, one way or another- bones, blood, teeth, pride, chairs, tables, cue sticks. Better to choose what will be sacrificed than have this thing be chosen for you- in the above case, I chose my forehead, because it is hard and I don't have to use it the way I have to use my other body parts throughout the course of the day â€¦ try eating breakfast with a broken hand. Anyway, this is a good example of what I am sometimes required to do when some jerk steps across the line of civility in that particular establishment. And this was about to happen again, the night Salinger died.
