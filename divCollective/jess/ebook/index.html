If you really want to hear about it the first thing you'll probably want to know is that a bar isn't a place of sacrifice â€¦ surrender, solitude, cirrhosis, sure, but not sacrifice. Unless you are the bouncer. I'm the bouncer. And being the bouncer is a lot like being the designated driver at a raging house party. It is part drug intervention and part animal planet. The difference is that most interventions are well-planned, emotionally sensitive ordeals, and say what you want about the late Steve Irwin, but at least the wild animals he was pissing off were sober.

     I don't know how I got this fucking job. Well, that's not true, but I do honestly have to ask myself what the hell I am doing in this line of work from time to time. Right about now I should mention that I am roughly five foot seven, and a hundred forty-five pounds. Normally, a person of my size would not be employed in this type of profession because I don't look like some Cro-Magnon-gorilla-Frankenstein-manbeast with tattoos on my neck and a head the size of an industrial-grade microwave. But I am a martial arts instructor, and the head teacher of my dojo referred my services to the bar owner.

     I want to make it clear that while I do sometimes enjoy physically harming people, I would never actively pursue a situation where that sort of thing could happen, without very good reason. Years ago I dedicated my life to the study/teaching of my discipline, and though that sounds very romantic and all, the brass tacks of the matter is that working a second job is the only way to sustain this dedication. The dojo, though formidable, is a small establishment and working there alone cannot fully financially support me. I make about one hundred-fifty dollars a night while bouncing, and for only this reason, I hold this vocation. It was a sacrifice I was willing to make for the love of something that kept me alive.

     My theory on dreams, lifestyles, achievements, goals, etc, is that to reach them, something will be sacrificed, regardless- and it is always better to choose what it is that will be sacrificed, rather than allow the natural process of stress and striving to choose for me. The latter is how things and people get neglected, pawned, and/or unnecessarily damaged.
