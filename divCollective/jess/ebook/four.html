The fact that I was thinking of literature at a time when I should have been scanning the bar for potential threats, irked me. Taking the burning double shot of Crown Royal whiskey and chasing it down with a beer-back of Heineken was my protest against this lack of discipline. The bar was loud, rowdy and growing like the reaching leaves of some wind-ripped jungle; Haoa was on the outdoor porch near the other exit staring at me strangely. He motioned with his thumb to my left, and it was then I realized that there was a small troop of college kids waiting in line with their I.D. cards in various forms of presentation. Startled out of my distant state, I did my job - carefully inspecting driver's licenses hailing from all over the country. Most of the line consisted of girls, but towards the back of that entering group were some very drunk, very large young men.

     I've found that the average person, when presented with a situation that does not coincide with their perception of the world and its workings, will receive this disconnect with caution. There is usually a moment when they realize that there is something very strange about the circumstance they've just encountered. In my world, it goes something like this:

     Me: Hey can I check your ID please?

     Patron: Sure.

     And then there is the inner monologue that goes on during the period of time when I am using a small handheld flashlight to check birth dates on shiny plastic rectangles. I imagine it sounds a bit like:

     Patron: (The little man here, who is paid to beat me up and drag me out if I get too drunk, doesn't look like any of the other men who are usually paid to do this â€¦ either this bar is laid back, or this man is very dangerous. There is something unnerving about how calm he is and it makes me feel strange inside. Avoid eye contact.)

     Most folk act accordingly and my night goes on without incident. But alcohol is a powerful drug, and when mixed with the type of unabashed personality that enjoys vocalized self-expression, problems manifest instantly. On that night, the night J.D. Salinger died, when Haoa and I were working the place, the very large, very drunk men who stumbled in were of the former disposition.
