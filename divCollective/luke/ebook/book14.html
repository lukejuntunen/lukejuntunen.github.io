     "So you're blaming me for the refrigerator being broken," he asked her. "What about the car? I could blame you for the shattered windshield."<br />

     Her skin was bluish, pale. Her eyes had no white, only red and green. Sleep deprivation gave a little bit of money, but that wasn't why she lay there awake at night. She was in pain. Her head ached endlessly but she refused to go back to the doctor, saying that they would never get ahead if they had to pay yet another hospital bill.<br />

     When the repairman came to work on the refrigerator he informed them that their warranty didn't cover the damage. Alice exploded in the man's face. He was short, bald, heavy. On his fingers were rings, gold and silver. He wore long blue overalls with a nametag that read "Randy."<br />

     "Miss, I don't make the rules...." he started to say.<br />

     John, dabbing at an injury on his chin that wouldn't stop bleeding, walked in on his wife striking the man on his head with a wooden spoon. He was older, slow from his weight and had a limp in his right leg.<br />

     "Alice!" John yelled. He pulled her off of the heavy man who was covering his face with his hands. The clank of the wooden spoon hitting his rings had played in unison with the change rattling in the teapot.<br />

     Alice lurched at the recoiled man with her feet, John having hold of her top half. Her foot planted firmly on the man's nose, breaking it instantly. Blood roared out of his nostrils, onto his lips and eventually onto the already blood-stained floor.<br />

     "You're crazy!" he screamed at her. "You're wife's a crazy bitch!" He covered his face with his hand.<br />

     "She's not crazy," John responded calmly.<br />

     John walked over to the teapot and pulled out a newly formed hundred dollar bill. He handed it to the repairman.<br />
