     "We'll never get ahead, John. We never have and we never will. The moment we get any money something breaks or one of the children...."<br />

     They argued for an hour, Alice the entire time clutching the closed teapot. She called him a loser three times during the fight and he once, out of frustration, told her that she had been a bad mother. It was the dirtiest they had ever treated one another. When they finished, when both were hunched over in exhaustion from not having eaten breakfast, Alice lifted the lid to find the teapot filled with twenty dollar bills. There was just over four hundred dollars.<br />

     "But how?" John asked.<br />

     Alice reared back and spit in his face. She then told him how she came home for lunch whenever she could in hopes that the postman would be walking his route and say hello to her.<br />

     A twenty dollar bill appeared, though John was too hunched over to see it.<br />

     "Now you do me!" she said.<br />

     "You're a bitch!" he said. Change clinked.<br />

     "No! Do me for real. Tell me something that you hate about me or something awful that you've done. Something that will really hurt my feelings."<br />

     John thought as he sat at the table, still trying to form the picture of what their postman looked like.<br />

     "I slept with Ellen Waterson...."<br />

     "I already know that," she interrupted.<br />

     "I slept with her after you and I were dating," he said spitefully.<br />

     It had been a secret. Words festering beneath John's skin for twenty years. He could smell the words at night while he was lying in bed, next to Alice. Mildewed, damp, green words under his skin but not in his blood.<br />
