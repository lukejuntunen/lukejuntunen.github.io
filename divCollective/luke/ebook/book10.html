     Her face was pale but a smile crept onto it as she looked in the teapot and saw a fifty dollar bill appear.<br />

     "Keep going," she said.<br />

     The two proceeded to tell one another everything. Things which no married couple have ever shared. John told her about the woman at work, the one who might be replacing him, and how wonderfully upright her breasts were. Alice told him about the men she had been with before him and the things she had allowed them to do that she would never allow John to do to her. They did still love one another and by the end of the day the pot had given them over a thousand dollars. More than either of them could make in a week at their job.<br />

     They continued on the next day, after shouting at one another so furiously that they had each finally retreated to their corners and cried themselves to sleep. John got a call on the fourth day from his boss saying that he shouldn't bother coming in again. That she could handle it.<br />

     "Fine," John replied. "I've found something else anyway." His boss was surprised at the lack of emotion. Alice, too, decided to not return to her employer. Though they were running short on secrets and genuine insults - insincere insults didn't pay a dime - they had still worked up enough money to get by for months.<br />

     Each morning they woke up late, sometimes not until after noon, typically alone, and they met at the kitchen table where they set the teapot in between them.<br />

     "I always referred to you as loose when we were in high school," John said.<br />

     Clank. Clank. Clank.<br />

     "You have never given me an orgasm," Alice replied.<br />

     Three twenty dollar bills.<br />
