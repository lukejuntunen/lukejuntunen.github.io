	   <p>Maybe they were hiring.</p>


    <p> I tried to tear off a large sheet of it, but Bill Lexx reached through the broken window, 
     grabbed that whole roll and threw it straight to the ground. He didn't seem to care that he had 
     glass stuck in his hand, a few brittle shards embedded around his knuckles.</p>


     <p>"Bill. Come inside. Please. Don't jump. I mean, look, look! You popped out the glass, you can crawl through, 
     at least…I can get an ambulance…the hospital's only a block or…"</p>


    <p> "Shut the hell up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up."</p>


    <p> And I'm thinking it's amazing that not one single man has walked into this bathroom yet.
      We must have some powerful bladders in this building. I was actually starting to get pissed off, you know? 
      Why did I have to deal with this? I wasn't all that close to Bill Lexx; we don't even work in the same department. 
      God, why did I even look at his damn socks.</p>


    <p> Still, I was in the middle of it now.

     Here I was petitioning for an arbitrary man's life, rallying for his unborn twins and 
     pitiful wife, for his seemingly indiscriminate purpose for living.

     Bill stopped crying and stood up. He had alternated half-stand to crouch for most of his confessional. 
     He was bleeding all over his suit, it was navy, a polyester blend, and the empty window frame. He put his 
     hand on the brick wall of the building, preparing to fully stand, I thought.</p>


    <p> His hand had such a large spread.

     His shoulders relaxed, and he leaned against the wall, standing straight up.
      He must have been over six feet tall. I guess that's how I saw his socks to begin with; his pants didn't 
      quite fit the length of his legs. He grabbed onto the window frame.

     My left hand had been holding, white-knuckled, to the glassless frame stuck on the ledge; 
     my arm shot out to grab it when he first started to stand up, for support. I guess I was so nervous
     , I'd forgotten — as I backed away, you know, to give Bill Lexx room, I backed away holding to the window frame.
      That with the pressure of Bill's weight must have been exactly the force needed because we dislodged the window. 
      And while I was standing there, my crotch wet from urine, unable to let go of the window frame, Bill Lexx sucked in 
      a quick breath, his hand slipped from the brick, and over the side he went, without exhaling.</p>
