	 <p>Of course, this side of the building faced the executive parking lot.</p>

     <p>I didn't know why that was important, at first.

     Bill Lexx's wife is pregnant with twins. She doesn't have a job. Bill had 
     a wonderful health plan through the company. Two months away from five years in the same 
     position. Raises usually start around then. It was the perfect job for a man of exactitude, as he seemed to be.<

     Bill says he has no idea what happened to the money. I believe him.

     Then, again, the tears.</p>

    <p> "I signed the papers, I signed off on them, the papers…I know that it it it it it came to the office.
     Alicia knows…. She can…she she…she'll tell you that!!"</p>
     
     <p> Margie may smoke, but at least she's efficient. But,
      then, I didn't really know Alicia, other than she'd worn a 
      cotton antler headband with bells on them, at the last three Christmas parties.

     It must have been a large amount of money.</p>

    <p> I looked down below us. You know, three stories is not all that high. I mean it's not so high 
     that people can't notice you, especially when you're standing on the ledge outside of the building. 
     But nobody even looked at us; none of the people walking by paid any attention.

     He quit crying.

     And, then, Bill Lexx asked me to forgive him.</p>

   <p>  "Tell me you forgive me!" He was becoming irrational.</p>

     <p>So, I told him.

     "I forgive you."</p>

     <p>What harm could it do? If it helped him to realize what he was doing, if it helped him think rationally, 
     you know, why not, I'd do it. I mean, I did it. Maybe in a bizarre way I was speaking for the company, you know, 
     to him. I don't know. At the same time, and it hit me all of a sudden, it…it seemed an enormous responsibility for 
     me to forgive this man.</p>
