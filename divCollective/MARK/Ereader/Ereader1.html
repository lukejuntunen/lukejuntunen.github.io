	<p>This man, Bill Lexx, as I was about to find out, was standing in front of the third story men's bathroom window when 
	I went to use it this morning. Outside the window, not inside the bathroom, but on the outside, in a suit, which I might 
	add was not a three-piece, and he had taken his tie off; his socks didn't match the color of his suit. I only noticed that
	 because I sit down when I pee. I know a lot of men don't do that, or would never admit it, but I do. My grandmother taught 
	 me it was impolite to be heard using the bathroom, period.</p>

    <p> So, I'm sitting on the toilet, and this man, Bill, I guess he heard me, because 
     I had to put the toilet seat down, you know, so I could sit on it, and it clanged against
      the porcelain base of the toilet. And he turns around and stares at me. Thank God I hadn't taken 
      my pants off yet. I'd sat down on the toilet to retie my shoes.
	I forgot to mention that.</p>

     <p>See, Margie, the secretary in my office, made me untie my shoes when she was getting off the elevator. 
     I mean, accidentally, made me untie them. She goes down to the basement to smoke instead of outside, says 
     she can't completely appreciate a cigarette outside. I had walked a little past the elevator, not meaning to not speak, 
     and then felt guilty and didn't want to be rude so I turned around to speak, and in the process of turning around,
      I stepped on my left shoestring.

     She couldn't have cared less.</p>

    <p> The elevator doors shut. So, I took the stairs up to the next floor to go to the bathroom. 
     The bathrooms weren't designed with common sense in mind, just the safety of each gender. The building itself 
     has only had one renovation, and that was out of necessity due to Camille, back in 1969. Nothing else has ever been 
     done to alter its appearance, not even for convenience. It found its way onto the National Registry, about a hundred years
      after it housed Confederate soldiers; now, it exists to depreciate history.</p>
