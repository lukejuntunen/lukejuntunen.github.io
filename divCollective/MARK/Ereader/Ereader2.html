	<p>The men's bathrooms are on every other floor.

     And right as I got to the third floor, I saw Mr. Yola and got nervous.

     That's how my other shoe got untied because I stepped on my right shoestring when I saw him,
      but I couldn't stop right then to tie either of them back because I thought Yola had seen me, 
      and even though I was just going to the bathroom, he'd find some way to make me feel guilty for it. 
      He's now the number one man at the Shipping office, and has been since Mr. Leman was found dead floating 
      around Lake Tia O'Khata, last July. Yola's a true Mississippi gentleman; he doesn't have any children. 
      He was mumbling to himself and had a rather glossed look to his face; I just went on to the bathroom,
       and sat down on the toilet to tie my shoes.

     And I don't know what I was thinking. But after I tied my shoes, and this man, Bill, 
     you know, is still staring at me — I told him his socks didn't match his suit.</p>

     <p>"What?" Bill mouthed.</p>

     <p>He couldn't hear me; the window was closed. I got up and opened the window…however, 
     it's that old kind of window that opens out instead of raises up, so I had to ask him, 
     I had to raise my voice, to scoot over to the left a little bit so I could push the window out.</p>

     <p>"What!?"</p>

     <p>I tried not to raise my voice, first, and mouthed back at him, instead.
      You know like you do when you're in a car and you're talking to someone else in another car, 
      like at a stoplight, and maybe you know them.</p>

     <p>"Scoot over to the left. I cannot open the window. It opens out, not up."</p>

     I motioned with my arms to indicate what I was asking him to do. After a second or two, he caught on.
