	  <p>I want to say he fell at the same speed as the brown paper towel roll, according to physics, but he didn't. 
	  He fell in slow motion, he did.

     I watched him all the way down to the pavement; he landed a few feet from an illegally parked dark blue Lexus.
      Not too many shades different in color from his suit. A passer-by might have assumed he came with the car, or 
      had tripped out of it, consumed by an aneurysm that had caused a terrible nosebleed. For the fall to be such a 
      significant one, the result was relatively neat and contained.</p>

     <p>I guess I killed him. Not that I like admitting that to myself.

     It certainly hadn't been my intention. And, I suppose it doesn't even matter now what color his socks were. But, so you know, they were a light green, like a pistachio.

     Argyle, even. Never seen a pair like them since.</p>

    <p> I hope I never do.</p>
