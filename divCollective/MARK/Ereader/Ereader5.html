	  <p>You know, when I first came to work here, the Crisis Management Team, from Community Counseling — 
	  their offices are across the street in the Bancorp South building — was hired by this company to conduct a 
	  seminar on "Suicidal Tendencies in the Workforce."
     I didn't go.

     I didn't have suicidal tendencies.

     I don't think outside the box very well, I guess.</p>


    <p> "Bill, I know you haven't mentioned jumping off, from, from here, 
     and I am hoping it's because you are changing your mind if that was your original intention."</p>


    <p> "I, I….I just, I…" He stuttered. I waited for more.</p>


     <p>There was no more. He just stood still.

     I couldn't help but feel frustrated. Then, he started sobbing again.</p>


    <p> "Your wife is pregnant, Bill! You can't forget about that! She needs you; those babies 
     will need you! So you lost your job. You'll get another one!"</p>


   <p>  I didn't believe that myself. It's hard to come back from being fired.

     He got so mad he hit the window.

     Glass splintered everywhere, down to the ground and all over the ledge.

     Then, I peed my pants. I have a fear of ingesting glass; my father was an alcoholic.

     Thank God none of the glass hit me.

     This would have been a lot worse if we'd been in a kitchen, I thought, Be glad we're not in a kitchen.

     His hand was bleeding, naturally. I ran to the sink, to the towel dispenser and ripped out one of those big 
     rolls of brown paper towels that seem to thrive in industrial buildings. God, I bet that company makes some money.</p>
