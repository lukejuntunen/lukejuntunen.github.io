 <p>I pushed the window out, and then we had another problem. The window got stuck. See, the windows are tall, 
 and they're plain glass, by the way, not frosted like in the ladies' which all bathroom windows should be, and 
 when I pushed them open, they split, you know, one went out to the right and the other to the left. And the left one, 
 on Bill's side, got stuck. I did try to close it back when I realized he couldn't then step around it, but it wouldn't
  budge. If the left window had gone all the way back to the wall of the building, he could have gotten around the window 
  and crawled back into the bathroom. But, as it was, he couldn't move, and the men's bathroom on the third floor is the 
  last room on that floor, on the east side of the building.</p>

    <p> Basically, he was trapped. There wasn't any other window for him to go to.

     I forgot all about peeing.

     I leaned out the window, and looked through the glass at him.</p>

    <p>"Hey! I was just trying to tell you your socks…didn't match…your… suit."</p>

    <p> I don't know what the hell I was thinking.

     Then, you know what he did; he started to cry. And I don't mean simple crying, I mean deep crying — 
     drool was stringing down from the sides of his lips, cutting off into drops — falling the length of three floors.

     I can't believe I told him his socks didn't match.

     I don't know what the hell I was thinking.</p>
     <p>Eight minutes ago, Mr. Yola fired Bill, without remorse, without regret. I'd passed him, 
     Yola, on his way back from Bill's office, apparently. The things I wouldn't have known if I 
     hadn't gone to the bathroom, huh?</p>

    <p> Bill Lexx (and he was very exact with this, methodical) said it took him six and a half minutes to 
    climb out of the break-room window and around to this side of the building. He took two steps a minute,
     precisely, except at the corner. Bill Lexx was very thorough about this process; I imagine he's rather good 
     at his job: an accountant. Or, you know, used to be. He was also very anxious to explain himself.</p>
