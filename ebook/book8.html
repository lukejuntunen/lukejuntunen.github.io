John had passed out on the couch not long after they returned home. Alice tinkered for a bit in the kitchen. He could hear whispers of "ow" and "shit" coming from the room, followed by the sound of change sprinkling into brass.<br />
     In the morning he realized he had overslept. Normally he would've been in his bed where the alarm was set, but in the living room all was silent. It was ten a.m. Alice was unaccounted for, as was the teapot. John rushed into work where they told him to go ahead and take the day off. They told him he looked "beat up." She could handle it on her own. She'd already proven that in less than two hours of processing shipments.<br />

     Dejected, John returned home to find his wife also not working.<br />

     "Why are you home?" she asked. He stared into her face. The noon sunlight made her face look even worse than it had in the restaurant.<br />

     "Why didn't you wake me up before you left this morning?" he asked.<br />

     She told him that she hadn't left that morning. She had accidentally knocked herself out in the garage when one of the hanging shovels had fallen on her head.<br />

     John felt around her skull until his fingers reached the bump.<br />

     "I'm fine," she said.<br />

     "We have to stop this!" he shouted. He forcefully took the teapot out of her arms and put it on top of a kitchen cupboard, where she couldn't reach. Undeterred, she scooted a chair over and took it down.<br />

     "We have an opportunity to finally get ahead!" she screamed back. This time she would not let him take the teapot from her grasp.<br />

     "Get ahead?" He explained to her that the only way they were going to get ahead was if they both worked their overtime. "Today's already set us back...."<br />
