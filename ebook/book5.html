        "What are you doing?" he asked, turning on the overhead light.<br />

     She tried to hide her face with a pillow from the couch, but he saw the bruise and the swelling.<br />

     "What happened?"<br />

     Alice's right eye was bloated, colored a dark purple. There was only a slit that she could peer out of. He ran to the kitchen and got the ice pack out of the freezer, laid it against her eye.<br />

     "Did someone attack you? Do I need to call the police?"<br />

     "The swelling will go down." After a long, heavy breath, after resting her throbbing head on her husband's shoulder, she suggested they use the money to go out to eat.<br />

     The thought of food, of a restaurant, which they couldn't afford anymore, was enough for John to forget the strangeness of his wife hitting herself in the face with an iron, if only momentarily.<br />
