    "It's going to blister," she said, applying the ice. He nodded and the two didn't speak until after she'd poured the coffee and he'd set out toast for each of them.<br />

     "What time do you think you'll be home tonight?" she asked.<br />

     "Late," he replied. There were shipments coming in from all over the country and he alone could work the new processing system for incoming orders. There was one other person, an up-and-coming woman straight out of college, but John preferred to do it himself. If she proved her worth too quickly he might find himself out of a job.<br />

     With his last gulp of coffee, just before he was going to stand up and kiss his wife goodbye, John found something floating in his mouth.<br />

     "Did you wash this thing out?"<br />

     "Of course. It's clean."<br />

     He pulled out some paper that had adhered to the roof of his mouth. It was a two-dollar bill.<br />

     "What the hell is this then?" he asked.<br />

     They both bent over the kitchen table where John laid the bill out to dry. Neither of the two could explain the presence of the money except to say that Alice must have missed it somehow when she was cleaning, though she swore she had scrubbed every angle of the brass teapot.<br />

     The two soon embraced for a long kiss, both regretting the fighting they had done over the long weekend. Alice's tongue snuck in through John's slightly parted lips. He squirmed with genuine surprise. His burned wrist brushed against his wife's cotton top as he reached to put his hand beneath it. He yelped again from the raw pain.<br />

     A nickel dropped in the teapot.<br />

     The two bent over and stared in wonder. John picked it out, held it up to the light.<br />
