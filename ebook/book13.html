     "You shouldn't have done that," John said, as they smiled and waved.<br />

     "It's fifty dollars that we're going to use to pay for her education!"<br />

     With all of their secrets scattered about their modest home, covered in broken glass and splintered wood, the two were forced to go back to beating themselves. John called his old boss and begged for his job on his boss's voicemail, but his calls were never returned.<br />

     The tuition bills came every three months, they were on the payment plan. In addition to that there was the electric bill, the mortgage, the water and the credit cards. Not to mention the fact that they had to take Alice to the emergency room to treat a concussion that she had given herself with one of the garage shovels.<br />

     A policeman had visited John in the waiting room and asked him questions. He had written John's answers into a little notebook and showed John pictures of Alice's bruises.<br />

     "She fell?" the policeman asked.<br />

     John nodded his head and stared off in the other direction.<br />

     At the end of each week John took a giant bucket of change to the bank to be counted out and returned in bills. The change was even diminishing. They had begun to expect four hundred dollars a week in change, but it soon dwindled to two hundred and fifty.<br />

     "The fridge doesn't work," Alice reported.<br />

     "What? Why not?" John asked, returning from a disappointing trip to the bank.<br />

     "I don't know," she replied. "Maybe because you punched it a thousand times."<br />

     Her attitude was changing with each new day. John suspected that she had given herself another concussion the week before when she'd "slipped" in the shower and he had to pull her unconscious body, dangling, crimson, wet head to the bed. She said it was an accident, but the teapot had been suspiciously in the room with her. They had found through trial and error that the teapot only worked when it was within a certain range of the person being wounded.<br />
