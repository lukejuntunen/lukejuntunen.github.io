    Alice reached over and pinched her husband's arm as hard as she could. Before he could cry out or push her hand away, there was the sound of dimes dropping in the teapot.<br />

     "How did that happen?" John asked.<br />

     "Hit me," she said.<br />

     He stared at her.<br />

     "Don't knock me out or anything. Punch me in my arm. Hard enough to leave a bruise."<br />

     John wouldn't hit her. Instead, he picked up his briefcase and headed for the front door.<br />

     "If I'm late they're going to let her handle the shipments. We can't afford for me to miss out on all of this overtime. We have tuition to pay in less than a month."<br />

     He kissed Alice and closed the door behind him.<br />

The routine was that Alice made dinner because she got home first ever since her demotion from accountant to glorified messenger. John made breakfast and handled all of the meals on the weekends. When John returned home that night, however, there wasn't the smell of any cooking in the air.<br />

     He found his wife lying on the couch, the teapot resting on her stomach. It was late, after ten, he had told his boss that he could handle things alone and told him to send her home because she would only be in the way. Without any help, it took him hours longer than it should have to finish processing the shipments.<br />

     John's stomach grumbled painfully at the lack of ready food. He hadn't eaten since toast at breakfast, there had been no time. The bile that churned, and had been churning everyday for months, had created an ulcer in John's stomach. His knees ached from standing for hours at a time.<br />

     The living room was dark, except for some light flickering out of the muted television set.<br />
