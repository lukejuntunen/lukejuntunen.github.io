     When the girl picked it up both parents lunged at her and pulled it from her hands.<br />

     "It's an antique," Alice commented, setting it back down gently on the coffee table.<br />

     "What happened to your eye, Mom?" the girl asked. There were four separate scars if one looked closely, but there was one brutal gash from where she'd struck herself with the iron that was noticeable at any distance.<br />

     "That's nothing. I fell," she said. The words in her mouth formed like "thank you" and "hello".<br />

     Alice looked at her daughter's unpinched, uncut, unbeaten skin with greedy eyes. When she hugged her, just before climbing the stairs to go to bed, Alice pinched her daughter beneath her arms and on her back.<br />

     "What'd you do that for?" the girl yelled. The sound of change clanging in the pot went unnoticed to her.<br />

     The girl left on Sunday, earlier than she had planned, because her mother had tripped and accidentally pushed her down the staircase while walking behind her. Her elbow might have had a small fracture and she wanted to go home to take advantage of the college's medical facilities. She thought it was strange that neither parent offered gas money.<br />
