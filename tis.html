				<h1>This is Art</h1>
				<br /><br />
				2013 - Single Channel Video - After Effects Motion Graphics
				<br /><br />
				<p>This is Art is a single channel motion graphics video that constitutes one of my first explorations into the medium. The piece's content evolves around a cheezy early motivational video that draws from the low budget public access lexicon. This however quickly becomes subverted as the video goes on and single frame shots flash across the screen to create an unbalance. This disturbs the viewer with much more obscene content as a seeming ghost in the machine reaches out with disturbing intentionality.<br /><br />The experimental nature of the piece is explored further in later videos that attempt to play with the same ideas of disturbance that is utilized on a single frame level. The video is meant not to be nessesarily read and understood explicitly, but rather to catch glimpses that set the viewer on edge and create a feeling.
